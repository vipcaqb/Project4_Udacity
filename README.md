## Project Overview

In this project, you will apply the skills you have acquired in this course to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API. 

The project contains a Machine Learning Microservice, built on **Scikit-Learn**. It contains a model that predicts house prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on [the data source site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). 

### Project Tasks

* Test your project code using linting
* Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application
* Deploy your containerized application using Docker and make a prediction
* Improve the log statements in the source code for this application
* Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
* Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
* Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that your code has been tested

---

## Setup the Environment

* Create a virtualenv with Python 3.7 and activate it. Refer to this link for help on specifying the Python version in the virtualenv. 
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
# You should have Python 3.7 available in your host. 
# Check the Python path using `which python3`
# Use a command similar to this one:
python3 -m venv ~/.devops
source ~/.devops/Scripts/activate
```
* Run `make install` to install the necessary dependencies

  
## START PROJECT


- Fork this repo and clone it to your local workstation (obviously)

### Step 1: Install dependencies
- Set up the environment by running `make setup`. This will create a virtual environment in your home directory called `.devops`
- Install dependencies by running `make install`
- (Optionally) Lint application (requires hadolint)

### Step 2: Run Docker container
- Run the application on docker by calling `./run_docker.sh`

### Step 3: Upload to Docker Hub
- In the `./upload_docker.sh` file, edit the dockerpath (line 8) and change the docker username to a personalized one (or leave it as is, to use the public kcemenike/microproject:v1.0.0)
- To upload to docker hub, run `./upload_docker.sh`

### Step 4: Kubernetes deployment
- To deploy to kubernetes, run `./run_kubernetes.sh`
